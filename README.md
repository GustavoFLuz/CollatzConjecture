# CollatzConjecture

A simple but precise experiment using JavaScript with VivaGraphJS to demonstrate visually the Collatz Conjecture

## But what is it? 
This conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved mathematics problem, which consists of:
1. Pick a number
2. If the number is even, divide by two
3. If the number is odd, multiply it by three and add one
4. Repeat the previous two steps until you get to one

The purpose of this experiment is to analyse the tree resulted from applying this conjecture in the first x numbers
